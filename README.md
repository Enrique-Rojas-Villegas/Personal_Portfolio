# Personal_Portfolio

File to understand Personal Portfolio

1. No code given this week, so I had to create it from scratch

2. Asked to complete the following:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

3. Used semantic elements in the index file
4. Use of a reset file to define general styles
5. Use of media queries for a responsive design
6. Use of display grid to better see the applications of the webpage.
